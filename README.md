# SimpleTpa Language Translations
----- worked on -----

## Welcome
You can download already translated configs or you can contribute to the them. Make sure that the config's version is equal to the current plugin's version!


## Translations
If contributed to an already translated config or you translated one, you will receive the role of Translator in my Discord Support Server.

1. How to start? First of all, decide whether you want to contribute to an already translated config or you will make a new translation of the config to another language.
!!! Please, DO NOT recreate already existing translated configs !!! This means if there is a Spanish translation already, do not create another Spanish translation. Instead, contribute to the translation.
2. Copy the **original** config.yml

## using another language 
If you want to use an new language you need to edit the config.yml.

1. Download SimpleTpa here https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simple-tpa.64270/.
2. Now that you have done that you will need to replace the config.yml in it on Ubuntu you can just open it with archive manager.
3. Now that you have opened it with archive manager you will see a file named config.yml open this file with an text editor. As you see the file is in the (original) english and you want it to change it to your own language.
4. So delete all the text in it and replace it with the text in the config file for the language you want. If you want to change it to dutch click on the folder Dutch on github.
5. Then open config.yml as you see this file is in Dutch now copy the text in the file and paste it in you EMPTY file.
6. Now save your changes and your done just put it in your plugin folder and start/ restart the server.

## Or 

if you already have ran the server with the plugin installed do this:

1. Go to the plugins folder.
2. when you are there there will be an folder named SimpleTpa
3. In the folder there is an file named config.yml
4. delete ALL the text in the file
5. now go to the folder of your language on the github if you want dutch go to the dutch folder
6. now open the file named config.yml and copy all the text inside.
7. now paste in your config.yml file on the server
8. restart the server and your done
